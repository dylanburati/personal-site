I released a collection of 6 mashups on
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/LVNvu8iD9hU) and
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/21nvolved/sets/mix001).
Apart from the intro, all are trap vocals over indie rock or electronic
instrumentals. I've wanted to make more original music for a while now,
so I hope having fewer unreleased mashups to work on will motivate me.

P.S. my piano pieces from 2018 are still on Bandcamp
[here](https://dylanburati.bandcamp.com/album/at-rest-in-a-position-comfortable-for-breathing).
I'd recommend that album if you're a fan of ambient artists like Eluvium
or of Angelo Badalamenti's _Soundtrack from Twin Peaks_.
