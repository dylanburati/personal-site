I passed Software Dev and Capstone, which are probably the most and
second-most time-consuming courses I've taken.
Software Dev made us keep a record (lines of code are `.py` and `.md` only):

| Partner   | Codebase | Hours | Weeks | Avg. hours | Avg. additions | Avg. deletions |
| --------- | :------: | :---: | :---: | :--------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| Katherine | A        | 60    | 5     | 12         | 1907           | 257.4          |
| Thomas    | B        | 52    | 2     | 26         | 3389           | 2105.5         |
| Jojo      | B        | 50    | 2     | 25         | 2674           | 1914           |

And all I got was this unplayable board game :)
