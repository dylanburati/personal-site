I'm a fourth-year Computer Engineering and Computer Science major at
Northeastern University. I started developing side projects the summer
before my freshman year, which helped me learn how to design, deploy,
and improve apps for the web and Android. I've also completed two
6-month software engineering co-ops, working with Node.js, Python, and
React Native. I'm interested in continuing with web development and
mobile app development as well as branching into data science and
machine learning.

Outside of software, I love to ski, play piano, and take photos like the
one in the header. I have one album of piano pieces on
[Bandcamp](http://dylanburati.bandcamp.com/album/at-rest-in-a-position-comfortable-for-breathing),
which was inspired by ***Eluvium &ndash; Copia*** and
***Angelo Badalamenti &ndash; Soundtrack from Twin Peaks***.
